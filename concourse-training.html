                <p>Our training explains everything you need to know in order to start using Concourse within a team.</p>
                <p>The course is delivered <em>on-site</em> throughout <em>one whole day</em>, with a heavy focus on <em>practical exercises</em> to ensure that trainees leave the session able to use Concourse immediately. We provide <em>multiple instructors</em> to walk the floor during these practical exercises, giving trainees the opportunity to ask questions and leverage EngineerBetter's experience of running Concourse in production.</p>
                <p>The course is programming-language agnostic - although some examples use Ruby to demonstrate testing a software product, no knowledge is required and the examples are simple and easy to understand.</p>

                    <h3>What is Concourse?</h3>
                  </header>
                  <p>Concourse is more than a regular continuous integration server.</p>
                  <p>Concourse features <em>pipelines</em> as a first-class citizen, allowing your organisation to visually map every resource and process that is involved in delivering value via software.</p>
                  <p>Concourse offers a predictable, <em>repeatable</em> and hassle-free CI experience.</p>

                    <h3>How Does Concourse Work?</h3>
                  </header>
                  <ul>
                    <li><em>Declarative</em> - all pipeline configuration is expressed in YAML files that can be kept under source control, allowing Pipelines-as-Code.</li>
                    <li><em>Immutable</em> - configuration can’t be changed through the UI, preventing ‘snowflake’ CI servers that are hard to recreate in a disaster.</li>
                    <li><em>Isolated</em> - all tasks run in containers, meaning that the output of one task cannot pollute or break another task or pipeline.</li>
                    <li><em>Externalised</em> - tasks are expressed as scripts that live in your code repositories, making your project portable with no lock-in to Concourse.</li>
                    <li><em>Repeatable</em> - all resources that provide input to a pipeline are versioned, allowing you to author idempotent and deterministic jobs.</li>
                    <li><em>Simple</em> - there are no plug-ins, which makes operating Concourse simple and means a buggy collection of open source plug-ins won’t break your builds. Extensibility is instead achieved through optional container images specified by each pipeline.</li>
                  </ul>
