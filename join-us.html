                    This talk summarises the way we see the world and why we're building this company.

                  </p>

                  <h3>The work</h3>
                  <p style="margin: 0 0 1em 0">
                    We're a small consultancy, and that means that we end up doing lots of different things, depending on what our customers ask for. <strong>Not&nbsp;everyone needs to do everything</strong>, and we expect people to have different strengths and preferences. The list of all the things we do includes:
                    <ul>
                      <li><strong>Pair-programming</strong> on-site with clients.</li>
                      <li>Pairing to <strong>develop CLIs, webapps and deployable distributed systems</strong> that make Cloud Foundry easier to use.</li>
                      <li>Creating and <strong>delivering training</strong>.</li>
                      <li>Helping build <strong>products or open source projects</strong> that contribute to the CF Community</li>
                      <li><strong>Work from home</strong> as and when it makes sense (so not constantly).</li>
                      <li><strong>Evangelising</strong> cloud-native development and PaaS usage.</li>
                    </ul>
