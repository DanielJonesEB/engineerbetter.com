                    <blockquote>
                        "They levelled up the entire team on day 1. The attitude and experience that
                        EngineerBetter brought to my team was infectious, and left a lasting mark on our
                        engineers. I would work with them again without hesitation."

                        "As a junior developer I was fearful about working with very experienced developers and pairing full time.
                        The team at EngineerBetter were really supportive, took their time and
                        gave my a wonderful pair programming experience. Now Iâ€™m able to pair confidently
                        with other teams!"

                    <blockquote>
                        "EngineerBetter has excellent cloud expertise, plus a great technical network which they leveraged on helping us
                        design and build out our Pivotal Cloud Foundry tile. They are an official System Integrator for Hazelcast so now
                        customers can benefit directly from their expertise"

                        "EngineerBetter have cut huge amounts of ice in the area of PCF
                        operability for our customers. Delivering 5x the software with 15% of the ops
                        effort are typical results for these folks. When they talked about the first time
                        their Cloud Foundry had upgraded itself overnight while everyone was asleep, I said
                        'I've been on a 22 year quest to make what you just said happen'"
