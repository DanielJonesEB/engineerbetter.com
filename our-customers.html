                    <blockquote>
                        "They levelled up the entire team on day 1. The attitude and experience that
                        EngineerBetter brought to my team was infectious, and left a lasting mark on our
                        engineers. I would work with them again without hesitation."

                    <blockquote>
                        "As a junior developer I was fearful about working with very experienced developers and pairing full time.
                        The team at EngineerBetter were really supportive, took their time and
                        gave my a wonderful pair programming experience. Now Iâ€™m able to pair confidently
                        with other teams!"

                        design and build out Pivotal Cloud Foundry Tile. They are now an official System Integrator for Hazelcast so now
                        customers can benefit directly from their expertise"
