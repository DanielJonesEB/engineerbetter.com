EngineerBetter recently had the pleasure of delivering a novel training course that bridges the gap between the one-to-one mentoring of pair-programming, and the more scalable one-to-many knowledge transfer of an instructor-led training course. I really do mean “pleasure” - these students were some of the most motivated and determined customers we’ve ever worked with.

The challenge: take 6 factory workers from a global manufacturer with some experience of assembly, C, C# and Visual Basic. In only five days have them deliver 12 Factor apps written in Java Spring Boot/JavaScript Node that ingest, store and visualise IoT data, and is under version control, test-driven, built using BDD stories, and continuously deployed to Cloud Foundry. Oh, and we only had two engineers available to help.

Did our students achieve the goal? Of course! So how did we help them do it?

The key to their success was our use of mob programming. Whilst the first day was mostly orientation and covering the wide range of tools and techniques we’d be using, the rest of the week was spent split into two teams: three students, and one EngineerBetter team leader.

Each team occupied their own room, with a single computer, mouse, keyboard, and one very large screen. One team member is appointed ‘driver’, and the rest of the team act as ‘navigators’. The driver’s job is to do exactly as instructed by the navigators, who do the decision making. Every ten minutes we rotate the role of driver, meaning everyone gets lots of keyboard time.

That the driver can only follow instructions means that every implemented idea must be vocalised. In order to get some code written, someone has to say something, thus allowing the team to discuss it. The driver is of course allowed to have ideas, but they’re not allowed to put them into the code without getting a navigator to tell them to - again, forcing discussion. This process makes all decisions transparent and explicit, and every member of the team is part of the thinking process.

The team worked from an ordered backlog in Pivotal Tracker, which is exactly how we work and exactly how we recommend that product teams work. The backlog was populated with stories created ahead-of-time from the customer’s requirements, in the form “As a factory owner, I can see the data dashboard” with step-by-step acceptance criteria. The students were enthused about this aspect of our working practice - they were excited clearly stating a thing that a user can or cannot do as a small batch of work would make for big improvements on their prior model of working from long, wide-ranging requirements documents.

By working on a real set of apps our students were constantly exposed to the ‘core loops’ of sustainable development, repeating fundamental practices in a way that we’re sure they’d remember them. Write the test, run the test, write the code, repeat; git add -p, git commit, git push; YAGNI-thinking when making engineering decisions; the list could go on.

Another benefit of delivering actual apps instead of traditional slide-based training was that we encountered real problems. Both teams hit obscure issues with their frameworks, which gave the students an insight into what experienced engineers do in such circumstances.

Did our students come away as fluent, self-sufficient cloud native developers? Absolutely not, and that was never the intention. We inundated them with information, which they were excited to take back to their workplace. If they remembered as much of 20% of what they experienced, then they’ll have done very well - but recall isn’t the point of this type of training.

Intensive immersive training is about enthusing students, giving them the confidence that comes from having done new things ‘for real’, exposing them to the breadth of what they don’t yet know, and showing them a holistic way of working that is more than the sum of its parts.

We can’t credit our students enough. They worked hard every day, swimming hard when their feet couldn’t reach the bottom. We took them out of their comfort zones, and they rose to the challenge admirably with a great work ethic and boundless curiosity.
