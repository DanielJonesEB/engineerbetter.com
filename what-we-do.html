                </header>
                <p>We enable customers to deliver business value faster with Cloud Foundry by <strong>pair-programming</strong> with their engineers over a number of months. We work from an <strong>ordered backlog</strong>, continuously delivering usable solutions into production.</p>
                <p>The approach of pair-programming is the most successful method for increasing knowledge in our customers' businesses whilst also delivering production systems.</p>
                <p style="margin: 0 0 1em 0">Examples of the solutions we've delivered include:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Concourse continuous delivery pipelines to stand up entire Cloud Foundry environments</li>
                  <li>Cloud Foundry buildpacks</li>
                  <li>Service brokers, BOSH releases and Pivotal Cloud Foundry tiles</li>

                <p>We provide on-site hands-on, instructor-led <strong>Cloud Foundry training</strong>.
                  After running <a href="https://cfsummiteu2016.sched.org/event/7qxA/training-cloud-foundry-for-beginners-from-zero-to-hero-dan-young-daniel-jones-peter-jones-engineerbetter-additional-fee-required-to-attend">training at Cloud Foundry Summit</a>
                  the Cloud Foundry Foundation asked us to build the official training course for the Cloud Foundry Certified Developer exam.</p>

                <p>We offer two levels of course. The aim of both of them is to establish a robust and accurate mental model of Cloud Foundry,
                  by experiencing how to use the platform through practical exercises. Students are not given step-by-step instructions;
                  instead the practical exercises lead them to discover solutions through use of the CF CLI and the CF documentation.
                <p>
