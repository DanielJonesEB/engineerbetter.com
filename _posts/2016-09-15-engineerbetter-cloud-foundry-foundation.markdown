We're very pleased to announce that EngineerBetter Ltd is now a <strong>silver member</strong> of the <a href="https://www.cloudfoundry.org/membership/members/">Cloud Foundry Foundation</a>.

EngineerBetter is the <strong>only UK-native consultancy</strong> that is a member of the Cloud Foundry Foundation. We're also independent, with no vested interest in selling you one distribution or another.

We believe that Platform-as-a-Service is key to enabling faster delivery of business value. Cloud Foundry offers the most mature and flexible PaaS that your business can run on-premise or in the public cloud, and leveraging the vast engineering effort that has gone into Cloud Foundry saves adopters from having to reinvent the wheel with their own hand-crafted PaaS.

The Cloud Foundry Foundation's role as a steward of the project is important to ensure that vendor lock-in is never a problem for Cloud Foundry users, and having a vendor-agnostic organisation to present a unified marketing front is hugely valuable. The Cloud Foundry Foundation is headed by Sam Ramji, and his vision of a collaborative and respectful ecosystem is embodied by the awesome team that he has assembled. It's for these reasons that we're proud to be a part of the Foundation and to help promote its values.
